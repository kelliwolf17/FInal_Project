## Week 3 Visualization Improvements

### Data manipulation steps
 - Added another data layer for analysis - State and National Parks. See Parks.csv. 
 - Binning: To better show differences on the map, we binned the obesity/capita, restaurant/capita and gym/capita into bins based on quartiles from the describe() function.   
        See tableau_bins jupyter notebook.

 - See difference between binning and using raw data.

### Tableau changes
 - Created a story and published it to Tableau public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jennifer1946#!/vizhome/DiabetesFinalProject_16180665161890/Diabetes?publish=yes
 - Created a map with the obesity bins and added a filter for the other factors - restaurants/capita, gyms/capita, parks/capita and parks #. 
 - Ensured color scheme is color blind friendly. Used this source to determine colors to use: https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40
