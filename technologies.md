# Technologies Used

## Communication
For the purposes of group communication, we are using Slack and Zoom Video to keep in touch and communicate. We are also using Github to split up project duties and work colllaboratively together.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and to perform our exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
We will use MySQL as our Relational Database Management System to store and query our data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using for our model. We will use random forest for classification, regression, and clustering. We chose this technology because we can identify which are the most important features and it will handle data outliers and is efficient with non-linear data.  This will be useful for our secondary analysis, as well.

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau to create an aesthetically pleasing Dashboard and present the data in a dynamic and interactive manner.
