Transforming data using R:

Use tidyverse function in R to add a column for the actual diabetes value = data value * sample size. 

Example code: 
> demo_table <- demo_table %>% mutate(Mileage_per_Year=Total_Miles/(2020-Year),IsActive=TRUE) #add columns to original data frame


We can also reshape the data using the spread() funciton. We need to take Topic and Response from Long to Wide. Topic is column name and response is column data.
Example code. 
> wide_table <- long_table %>% spread(key="Metric",value="Score")

Dropping rows:
I think we should drop the rows with this text:
Median value reported with no confidence intervals

Drop unneccesary columnns:
Id, year, data value type, data value, data  value footnote symbol, data value footnote, sample size, stratification, stratification type, indicatorID, locationorder, partentstatedisplayorder, 

Then move Dataframe back to python/jupyter notebook and:

run one hot encoder on the categorical features: age, diabetes, tobacco, etc.

Check that the remaining # values to include in the analysis are numbers/not strings. - new data value.

?????Do we want to only keep rows with a lower range of confidence intervals? (subtracting high from low confidence limit) http://www.biostathandbook.com/confidence.html

Maybe we do this secondarily if we want to improve the accuracy of our model?

Then we scale the data and split it.
