## Selected topic

For the purpose of this project, we have decided to analyze diabetes and it's associated risk factors. 

## Reason they selected the topic

We decided to analyze data pertaining to diabetes because we are interested in learning which risk factors are most effective in predicting a diabetes diagnosis. For this analysis, we found data for the following risk factors: Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Education, Ethnicity, Exercise, Fast Food, Gyms, Hypertension, Income, Sex, and Tobacco Use. 

## Description of the source of data

For each of the features relating to diabetes risk factors, we were able to pull data directly from the cdc.gov website. For each feature we want to analyze, we pulled data for the years 2000 through 2019. We also pulled gym data from statista.com and fast food data from a Kaggle dataset.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
Primarily, we want to know which risk factors have the strongest correlation to diabetes so we can add these features to our machine learning model and find out whether or not they are a good predictor.

We are also interested in doing secondary analysis on the gym, fast food, and BMI data to see what kind of correlation there is.
